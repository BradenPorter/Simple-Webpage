webbrowser.open("url") will open a url in your web browser
import turtle
window=turtle.Screen()
window.bgcolor("red")
window.exitonclick()
Above code creates a red screen with a turtle on it.
turtle is a class and if
brad=turtle.Turtle()
angie=turtle.Turtle()
brad and angie and instances of the turtle class
class is like a blueprint of a building, contains height, size, etc. ie information 
instance or object is the building itself which can do things specified in the class.
By calling the turtle class you are calling the init() function
from allows us to import a class from a module among other things

By calling a class say: client =rest.TwilioRestClient() we are calling TwilioRestClient()'s' __init__() function, init is a constructor because it constructs space in memory for...
The built in function <variable>=open(file_location) makes an object of file and we can do things with it like <variable>.read()
connection=urllib.urlopen("url") opens a connection

self is the object/ instance being created
In our program self points to the movie toy story
Instance variables are variables that are always prefixed with the word self. They are usually found in the __init__ constructor. A function defined inside a class and associated with and instance is called an instance method.
Class variables should be in all caps.
__name__ __mdule__ and __doc are predefined variables
Inheritance is when you tell a class panda(bear) panda will inherit instance variables and functions from class bear
Method overriding can be done by using the same name of a method that would be inherited by the parent class in the child class
Servers are computers which we connect to while browsing the web that host websites.
