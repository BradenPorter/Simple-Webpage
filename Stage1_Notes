An HTML element consists of content that is typed between a start and end tag. Webpages reside on servers which can be accessed via HTTP. Div tags are used to divide your content into boxes based on type. This is a type of block element, an element that reserves space around it. On the other hand, inline elements take up only a necessary amount of space on a single line.

Programmers indent whenever nesting an element so that their code is more readable. This results in a tree-like structure where roots, the parent elements, branch to child elements. When an element is nested in another, that element is a child of the parent element it is nested in. The parent element includes all of its children. Children elements nested in the same parent element are siblings. By nesting elements a programmer can include/affect a group of elements. Therefore avoid having to repeat code. Repetition is a slow, inefficient, and disorganized practice. Non repetitious code is more concise and requires less typing, but repetitious code is more complex and therefore error prone. By having non-repetitious code you can save time, easily make changes to your code, better read your code, and avoid errors. 

Using a text editor that is designed for code such Sublime Text helps the programmer think and work quicker and easier.
